=========================
(slide 1)

*Introduction*

* Semantic web / Linked data

* RDF(S), SKOS, OWL



























=========================
(slide 2)

*The problems*

* potential relations

* no scale of relevance

* lousy diagrams

* OWL <=> SKOS











 

=========================
(slide 3)

*Proposals / candidate solutions*

* properties for potential relations
  - ex:potential(Range, Domain, Predicate, PostPredicate)

* a property for ascribing a scalar value
for how fundamental is the concept
  - ex:fundamental

* different arrow heads and tails
  - not line styles, not color

* OWL class as subclass of SKOS concept
  - or express OWL and translate into SKOS
  - not: 
    * skos:Concept instance an OWL class
    * annotations on OWL classes
    * less formal ontology
    * extrapolate SKOS
  













========================
(slide 4)

*Conclusions*

These issues are now at least documented
and favors one to understand or propose solutions.

Potential next steps:
* Use these proposals

* Develop the visualization protocol

* Seeking for the URIs

* Confirmation that the OWL <=> SKOS
design is sound
