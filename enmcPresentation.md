=========================
(slide 1)

*Introduction*

* Semantic web / Linked data

* RDF(S), SKOS, OWL



























=========================
(slide 2)

*The problems*

* potential relations

* no scale of relevance

* lausy diagrams

* OWL <=> SKOS




 

=========================
(slide 3)

*Proposals / candidate solutions*

* properties for potential relations

* a property for ascribing a scalar value
for how fundamental is the concept

* different arrow heads and tails

* OWL class as subclass of SKOS concept













========================
(slide 4)

*Conclusions*

These issues are now at least documented
and favors one to understand or propose solutions.

* Use these proposals

* Develop the visualization protocol

* Seeking for the URIs

* Confirmation the the OWL <=> SKOS
design is sound
